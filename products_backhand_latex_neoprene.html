                            Our iconic UNO PREMIER model is presented with a totally innovative and different proposal
                            that will
                            make you stand out on your position. Backhand Robust and well armed application with a high
                            volume
                            embossing to give more cushioning and body to the glove, all mounted on highly breathable
                            textile
                            mesh that keeps the interior cool and comfortable. Cut:Ergonomic. It adjusts to the natural
                            shape of
                            the hand facilitating flexion and giving more comfort. Its construction was signi cantly
                            improved,
                            now it is much more comfortable and aesthetic. Palm:Duo Grip latex (double palm). The inner
                            layer of
                            the latex adheres and adjusts to the hand like a second skin, thus preventing the glove from
                            moving
                            from its place. It is a latex with great performance, excellent grip and cushioning.
                            DUALINK:Technology developed to provide a thin protective layer to the latex, blocks some
                            pores
                            avoiding excessive absorption of water and moisture inside the glove helping to maintain its
                            grip.
                            Closure:High frequency embossed neoprene cu with points of exion for freedom of movement.
                            External
                            lycra opening for easy hand entry. Wide wristband with an elastic point, customizable
                            textile
